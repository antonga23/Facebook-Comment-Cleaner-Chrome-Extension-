# Facebook-Comment-Cleaner-(Chrome-Extension)

The Facebook Comment Cleaner allows users to cleanse their newsfeed by hiding comments which primarily contain tagged friends or contain few words. This makes funny/interesting/useful comments easier to identify, especially in comment sections where sorting by relevance is not an option. The "cleaning" process may be accomplished in the following ways.

Automatic cleaning: 
When enabled, comments are cleaned according to settings on page load, and any new comments loaded afterwards are automatically targeted and removed.

Manual cleaning: 
Users may use buttons in the menu or hotkeys (alt+x, alt+z) to clean comments or restore previously cleaned comments according to settings. This manual option may be used with or without automatic cleaning enabled.
